--Your job is to split out the letters and numbers from the address provided, and return a table in the following format:

--    project
--    letters
--    numbers
--Case should be maintained.

--you will be provided with a full name and you have to return the name in columns as follows.

--Elmore 	Clementina 	O'Conner
--Note: Don't forget to remove spaces around names in your result.
--Note: Due to multicultural context, if full name has more than 3 words, consider the last 2 as first_lastname and second_lastname, all other names belonging to name.

--This kata is inspired by SQL Basics: Simple PIVOTING data by matt c.
--You need to build a pivot table WITHOUT using CROSSTAB function. Having two tables products and details you need to
--select a pivot table of products with counts of details occurrences (possible details values are ['good', 'ok', 'bad'].
--Results should be ordered by product's name.
--Model schema for the kata is:
--products     details
--id-----------productâ€”id
--name         id
--             detail
--your query should return table with next columns
-- name
-- good
-- ok
-- bad

--Let's consider a case where we have a students table and a courses table. The tables have the following structure:
--students:
--| id  | name     | email               |
--|-----|----------|---------------------|
--| 1   | John     | john@example.com    |
--| 2   | Sarah    | sarah@example.com   |
--| 3   | Robert   | robert@example.com  |
--...
--courses:
--| id  | student_id | course_name | score |
--|-----|------------|-------------|-------|
--| 1   | 1          | Math        | 90    |
--| 2   | 1          | Science     | 85    |
--| 3   | 2          | Math        | 92    |
--| 4   | 2          | Science     | 80    |
--...
--We need to find the students who have a higher score in Science than in Math.
--Your SQL query should return the student_id, name (the name of the student), and his or her difference in scores between these courses (named as score_difference).
--Order the result by the difference in scores in descending order, and if diffrence is the same, then by student_id in ascending order.
--Good Luck!
--Desired Output
--The desired output should look like this:
--student_id	name	score_difference
--         3	Robert	25
--         5	Emma	3
--         6	Olivia	2
--        10	James	2

--For this challenge you need to create a RECURSIVE Hierarchical query. You have a table employees of employees, you must
--order each employee by level. You must use a WITH statement and name it employee_levels after that has been defined you must select from it.
--A Level is in correlation what manager managers the employee. e.g. an employee with a manager_id of NULL is at level 1
--and then direct employees with the employee at level 1 will be level 2.
--employees table schema
--    id
--    first_name
--    last_name
--    manager_id (can be NULL)
--resultant schema
